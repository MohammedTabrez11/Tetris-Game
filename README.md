## Building and Running

### Prerequisites
- C++ compiler (GCC, Clang, or MSVC)
- Standard C++ libraries

### Windows
```
g++ Tetris_Game.cpp -o tetris.exe
./tetris.exe
```

### Linux/macOS
```
g++ Tetris_Game.cpp -o tetris
./tetris
```

## Technical Details

- Uses standard C++ libraries and minimal platform-specific code
- Cross-platform compatibility maintained using conditional compilation
- Terminal-based gameplay with Unicode emoji blocks
- Non-blocking keyboard input handling
- Game state persistence for high scores

## Implementation Notes

The game implements several cross-platform utilities:
- Console screen manipulation (clear screen, cursor positioning)
- Non-blocking keyboard input detection
- Unicode/emoji support for visual elements
- Timing mechanisms for piece movement and animations

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Here are some ideas for improvements:

- Add hold piece functionality
- Implement T-spin and other advanced move recognition
- Add local multiplayer mode
- Create a graphical version using SDL or SFML
- Add sound effects and music
